I'm sitting here in a boring room
It's just another rainy Sunday afternoon
I'm wasting my time
I got nothing to do
I'm hanging around
I'm waiting for you
But nothing ever happens and I wonder
I'm driving around in my car
I'm driving too fast
I'm driving too far
I'd like to change my point of view
I feel so lonely I'm waiting for you
But nothing ever happens and I wonder
I wonder how I wonder why
Yesterday you told me about the blue blue sky
And all that I can see
is just a yellow lemon-tree
I'm turning my head up and down
I'm turning turning turning turning
turning around
And all that I can see
is just a yellow lemon tree
I'm sitting in here I miss the power
I'd like to go out taking a shower
But there's a heavy cloud inside my head
I feel so tired, put myself into bed
Where nothing ever happens
And I wonder
Isolation is not good for me
Isolation, I don't want to
sit on a lemon tree
I'm stepping around in a desert of joy
Baby anyhow I'll get another toy
And everything will happen
And you'll wonder
I wonder how I wonder why
Yesterday you told me about the blue blue sky
And all that I can see
is just a yellow lemon-tree
I'm turning my head up and down
I'm turning turning turning turning
turning around
And all that I can see
is just a yellow lemon tree
yellow I wonder how I wonder
I wonder how I wonder why
Yesterday you told me about the blue blue sky
And all that I can see
And all that I can see
And all that I can see
is just a yellow lemon-tree
